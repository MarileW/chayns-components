## Installation

First you need to install the gallery part of the chayns-components.

```bash
# NPM
npm install @chayns-components/gallery

# Yarn
yarn add @chayns-components/gallery
```

> **Information:** Since the components have now been implemented with the styled-components
> library, the styles are delivered directly with the components. There is no need to load an extra
> stylesheet anymore.

## Usage

You can use the components in your project as in the following example.

```typescript jsx
import { Gallery } from '@chayns-components/gallery';

<Gallery />;
```
