    This is the storybook for the new version<sup>1</sup> of the chayns-components. You can find an
    overview of the components via the navigation on the left side. The basic components can be
    found in the Core section. Further components are located in a separate area.
</p>

> <sup>1</sup> In the new version the components were completely refactored. These have been
> changed to functional components with hooks. In addition, the animations have been partially
> optimized and converted to FramerMotion animations. The properties have also been updated to
> make their use clearer.

<h2 style={{ marginTop: '32px' }}>Installation</h2>

<p style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem' }}>
    First the components must be installed. We decide between the core components and other
    components.
</p>

```bash
# NPM
npm install @chayns-components/core
npm install @chayns-components/person-finder

# Yarn
yarn add @chayns-components/core
yarn add @chayns-components/person-finder
```
> **Information:** The styles for the components are supplied directly by the package in the new
> version.

<h2 style={{ marginTop: '32px' }}>Contribution</h2>

<p style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem' }}>
    First you need to install all the dependencies of the main project and the sub-projects
    and link them. Just use the following commands:
</p>

```bash
# NPM
npm install
lerna bootstrap

# Yarn
yarn install
lerna bootstrap
```

<p style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem' }}>
    Then use one of the following commands to launch the local version of the storybook
    and develop in it:
</p>

```bash
# NPM
npm run storybook

# Yarn
yarn run storybook
```

> **Information:** The local storybook is started via port 6006 of your localhost.
> You can reach this at the following URL: `http://localhost:6006/`
