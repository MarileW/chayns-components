    This is the storybook for the new version<sup>1</sup> of the chayns-components. You can find an
    overview of the components via the navigation on the left side. The basic components can be
    found in the Core section. Further components are located in a separate area.
</p>

> <sup>1</sup> In the new version the components were completely refactored. These have been changed
> to functional components with hooks. In addition, the animations have been partially optimized and
> converted to FramerMotion animations. The properties have also been updated to make their use clearer.

    Initially, ensure the installation of the core package along with any additional packages you wish to incorporate.
    Follow the commands outlined in the <b>Installation</b> guide for this purpose.
    Once all the packages are successfully installed, enclose your top-level
    elements with the ColorSchemeProvider as demonstrated below:
</p>

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { ColorSchemeProvider } from '@chayns-components/core';
import { ChaynsProvider, getSite } from 'chayns-api';

const AppWrapper = () => {
    const { color, colorMode } = getSite();

    return (
        <ChaynsProvider>
            <ColorSchemeProvider color={color} colorMode={colorMode}>
                <YourComponents/>
            </ColorSchemeProvider>
        </ChaynsProvider>
    )
}

export default AppWrapper;
```
